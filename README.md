ReadersDigest

Hello! This is my first solo project. It takes a thesaurus reference .txt file as input
and creates a Thesaurus data structure out of it, which is constructed of a vector
and many helpful methods. Additionally, this Thesaurus will be populated with KeyWord
objects, containing a word and its syllables. This will allow the ReadersDigest class
to access words and their syllables, thereby matching words of interest to their 
counterparts and synonyms in an inputted article or book, and giving a score on 
how interesting this media may be to the user.

Run Instructions: run using ./ReadersDigest thesaurusfile.txt article.txt

In the near future, this will be updated to use the Graph ADT rather than the Vector ADT,
allowing for far more data accession throughout the program. Additionally, API support 
will be introduced, allowing for a much more massive data set to be used.
